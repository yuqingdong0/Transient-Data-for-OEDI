# IEEE 123 Test Model
## Contents
The data is simulated through IEEE 123 bus system with 14 PVs in ATP-EMTP software. The ATP model is converted from an open-source model [IEEE123_PV.xml](https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/CIMHub/blob/feature/SETO/OEDI/xml/IEEE123_PV.xml) via [CIMHub](https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/CIMHub/tree/feature/SETO). The data format is in COMTRADE fileï¼ˆ.cfg and .dat).<br>
The data file label is named after the following rules:<br>
* Loading Condition: 0.4/1.0 --> l1/l2<br>
* PV Capacity: 0.4/0.6/0.8/1.0 --> c1/c2/c3/c4<br>
* Fault Location: ADJ1/197/450/82 --> b1/b2/b3/b4<br>
* Fault Type: Three-phase/Single-phase/Line-to-line phase fault --> f1/f2/f3<br>

*_ADJ1 is 250 feet away from the feeder_.<br>

## Results
The measured variables in each data file include: Feeder-head voltage/Feeder-head current/RMS current at three selected PV buses under the corresponding scenario. The fault is applied at 0.3s and never cleared. The time window is from 0.28s to 0.34s.
