# IEEE 123 Test Model
The data is simulated through IEEE 123 bus system with 14 PVs in ATP-EMTP software. The data format is in COMTRADE file. The fault is applied at 0.3s and never cleared. The time window is from 0.28s to 0.34s.
Loading Condition: 0.4/1.0 --> l1/l2
PV Capacity: 0.4/0.6/0.8/1.0 --> c1/c2/c3/c4
Fault Location: ADJ1/197/450/82 --> b1/b2/b3/b4
Fault Type: Three-phase/Single-phase/Line-to-line phase fault --> f1/f2/f3
* ADJ1 is 250 feet awy from the feeder.
