# IEEE 13 Test Model
The data is simulated through IEEE 13 bus system with 1 PV in ATP-EMTP software. The data format is in COMTRADE file. The fault is applied at 0.3s and never cleared. The time window is from 0.28s to 0.34s.<br>
* Loading Condition: 0.4/0.7/1.0 --> l1/l2/l3<br>
* PV Capacity: 0.2/1.0 --> c1/c2<br>
* Fault Location: ADJ1/634_bat1/xf1 --> b1/b2/b3<br>
* Fault Type: Three-phase/Single-phase/Line-to-line phase fault --> f1/f2/f3<br>

*ADJ1 is 250 feet awy from the feeder.
